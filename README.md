It's funny, because of github I grew to like markdown and now I'm writing
this.

I chose Markdown to document things at work and at home because it's readable
in plain and compileable into sweet HTML and PDF, so it can easily be put on a
webserver and made public and accessable. Since maintaining one file for
everything would get messy and having 15 folders with 20 files each is
confusing I tried to make it manageable, while retaining the incredible
simplicity of markdown and the portability of text files.

## Usage

Put your current markdown files in the doc folder, with subfolders for
topics/groups. Then open index.html in a browser and enjoy!

Needs a markdown compiler to compile the files into HTML, which are then used
to display in the browser.

## Planned Features

- Browser markdown editor to do everything in the browser
